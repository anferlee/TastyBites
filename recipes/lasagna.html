            <h2>Description</h2>
                <p>No-Noodle Zucchini Lasagna is a lighter, low-carb twist on the classic Italian comfort dish. Thinly sliced zucchini takes the place of traditional pasta, layered with rich, savory meat sauce, creamy ricotta, and gooey melted mozzarella. Baked to perfection, this hearty casserole delivers all the familiar lasagna flavors without the heaviness of noodles. Perfect for weeknight dinners or meal prep, it's a wholesome and satisfying option whether you're cutting carbs or simply craving something fresh and flavorful.</p>
            <h2>Ingredients</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>3–4 medium zucchinis, thinly sliced lengthwise (use a mandoline for best results)</li>
                    <li>1 tsp salt</li>
                    <li>1 tbsp olive oil</li>
                    <li>1 lb ground beef or ground turkey</li>
                    <li>1 small onion, finely chopped</li>
                    <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
                    <li>1 can (28 oz) crushed tomatoes</li>
                    <li>1 tbsp tomato paste</li>
                    <li>1 tsp dried basil</li>
                    <li>1 tsp dried oregano</li>
                    <li>Salt & pepper to taste</li>
                    <li>¼ tsp red pepper flakes for heat</li>
                    <li>1½ cups ricotta cheese (or cottage cheese)</li>
                    <li>1 egg</li>
                    <li>½ cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
                    <li>2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese, divided</li>
                    <li>1 tbsp chopped fresh parsley or 1 tsp dried</li>
                </ul>
            <h2>Directions</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
                    <li>Slice the zucchini into long, thin strips using a knife or mandoline. Lay the slices on paper towels and sprinkle them with salt. Let them sit for 15–20 minutes to release moisture. Afterward, pat them dry with more paper towels. (Optional: Pre-bake or grill the slices at 400°F for 5–7 minutes to remove excess moisture.)</li>
                    <li>Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the chopped onion and sauté for about 3 minutes until softened. Stir in the minced garlic and cook for 30 seconds. Add the ground meat and cook until browned. Drain any excess fat. Stir in the crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, basil, oregano, red pepper flakes (if using), salt, and pepper. Simmer the sauce uncovered for 10–15 minutes until thickened.</li>
                    <li>In a mixing bowl, combine the ricotta cheese, egg, Parmesan cheese, 1 cup of shredded mozzarella, and parsley. Mix until well combined and creamy.</li>
                    <li>In a 9x13-inch baking dish, spread a thin layer of meat sauce on the bottom. Place a single layer of zucchini slices over the sauce. Spread a layer of the ricotta cheese mixture over the zucchini. Repeat the layers in this order—meat sauce, zucchini, ricotta—until all ingredients are used, finishing with a final layer of meat sauce. Top with the remaining 1 cup of mozzarella cheese.</li>
                    <li>Cover the dish loosely with foil (tent it so it doesn't touch the cheese) and bake at 375°F (190°C) for 30 minutes. Then remove the foil and bake for an additional 10–15 minutes until the top is bubbly and golden.</li>
                    <li>Allow the lasagna to rest for 10–15 minutes before slicing. This helps it set and makes serving easier.</li>
                </ol>
