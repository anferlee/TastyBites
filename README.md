# TastyBites | My First Recipe Website

As I began my journey into web development, I wanted to create something both familiar and functional — a website that would let me apply my new skills in a practical way. I chose to build a recipe site not only because I enjoy cooking, but also because it allowed me to focus on organizing structured content across multiple pages. It was the perfect first project to help bridge the gap between learning the theory of HTML/CSS and building something real.

## Project Introduction & Reflection

This project represents my first hands-on experience building a functional website from scratch — a simple yet purposeful recipe site crafted using clean, semantic HTML and foundational CSS styling. Designed as part of my front-end development journey, the goal of this project was to apply core web development principles in a practical, real-world context while gaining fluency with basic development tools and workflows.

The site showcases a curated selection of recipes, structured across multiple pages, each thoughtfully organized for clarity and ease of navigation. Through the process of building this project, I focused on writing semantic HTML to ensure that the content is accessible and well-structured. I also practiced organizing visual elements using CSS, experimenting with layout techniques, typography, color schemes, and spacing to improve the site’s readability and design consistency.

In addition to HTML and CSS, this project gave me the opportunity to practice key development skills, including:

    Creating and linking semantic HTML pages

    Structuring content using headings, paragraphs, lists, and images

    Implementing basic CSS styling for layout, color, and typography

    Managing relative file paths and directory structure for a multi-page site

    Using Git for version control and pushing updates to GitHub

Beyond the technical skills, I learned the importance of maintaining consistent design language across pages, organizing files in a scalable way, and adopting version control as an integral part of the development workflow. This project helped me internalize the foundational concepts of front-end development and reinforced good habits that I will carry forward into more complex projects.

In reflection, completing this recipe website marked a major milestone in my learning journey. It allowed me to move beyond tutorials and actively build something I could share, review, and improve over time. It’s a strong first step toward mastering front-end development and growing my confidence as a web developer.
