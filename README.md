# My First Recipe Website

## Project Introduction / Reflection – Recipe Website

This project is a simple recipe website designed to display a collection of recipes using clean HTML and CSS. It serves as an introductory web development project, helping solidify the foundations of structuring content with HTML and applying basic styling with CSS.

By completing this project, I will have demonstrated the ability to:

    Create semantic HTML pages

    Organize content effectively using headings, paragraphs, lists, and links

    Apply CSS for layout, color, and typography

    Work with relative file paths and folder structures

    Use Git and GitHub to manage and share a codebase

This project also helped me better understand how to build multi-page websites and the importance of consistent styling and navigation. It’s a practical first step toward becoming a front-end web developer.
